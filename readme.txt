My GUI program is able to randomly select tiles with an equal chance for
any tile to be selected, and then allow the scrabble tiles to be dragged
and drop those tiles onto the scrabble board. When a tile is dropped, the 
program shows what the current score of the user is, and what was the user
has made. The board itself contains four bonus squares, and the bonuses are
applied immediately when the user drops a tile onto the bonus square. The user
can continue onto the next round, which would keep the current score and refill
the user's hand to have 7 tiles, only filling the empty spots, also clearing the
board. The user can continue this until the tiles are all used up, or the user quits
and restarts the game using the restart game function. The user can drag the tiles
back and forth between the board and the rack, and cannot place tiles on top of each
other, or anywhere other than the rack or the board. The user can restart the game at
any point in time.
